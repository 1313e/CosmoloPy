<p><a href='http://roban.github.com/CosmoloPy/'>CosmoloPy</a> is a
package of basic cosmology routines for Python, designed for use with
<a href='http://scipy.org/'>NumPy and SciPy</a>. Features currently
include: calculation of cosmological distance measures,
perturbation-theory-based calculation of the matter power spectrum and
halo collapse fraction (courtesy of Eisenstein & Hu's transfer
function code), and integration of simple reionization models and the
resulting electron scattering optical depth due to reionization. I
hope it will prove useful to the increasing number of astronomers
turning to Python.</p>

<p>Ideally, science is a cooperative social effort (as exemplified by
this blog). A key to that cooperation (and to the fundamental notion
of reproducibility) is that scientists make the code they use in their
research freely available to their colleagues. To that end, I have
released CosmoloPy under
the <a href='http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php'>MIT
software license</a>, which allows it to be freely used and
modified. So
please <a href='http://roban.github.com/CosmoloPy/#download'>download
it</a>, use it, and request or add features you'd like to see included
(and point out bugs we need to fix). Anyone can
access <a href='http://github.com/roban/CosmoloPy/tree/master'>the git
repository</a>, so please edit the code and send in useful changes and
additions. All questions about use or development can be posted to
the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/cosmolopy-devel'>developer
discussion group</a>.</p>
