Python Interface
================

I use swig to generate the python interface to `power.c`.

`power_wrap.c` and `power.py` are created from `power.i` and `power.c`
by runing:

 > swig -python power.i

I used to let distutils run swig, but that stopped working for some
reason. The code was:

  power_module = Extension('cosmolopy.EH._power',
  sources=[os.path.join(eh_dir, 'power.i'), os.path.join(eh_dir,
  'power.c')])

I still let distutils do the compiling to create `_power.so`. This has
the advantage of not requiring the user to install swig.
